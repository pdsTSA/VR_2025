Take out the mesh and put it into the world,
enter the texture folder and drag the texture to the objects that are named the same
for example the bed, drag the bed material to the bed object, and by the way, don't forget that some of the objects have to be insterted multiple times on different places, for example, the bed, you'd have to drag the bed material, then place it to the blanket, cushion, the other cushion, back rest, and pillow, and the wood

bed is for bed (apply textures 6 times because there are 6 separate objects)
table 0 is right beside the bed (apply the texture once)
table 1 is the tv table
the TV texture and the monitor texture (I'm pretty sure you guys understand which one is which, you have to apply the texture 2 times, one is on the face of the actual screen, and other is on the face of the back support)
if you are wondering where the hell the table for the work station is, it's called Computer table
for the room you have to apply the texture to the door, door handle(don't forget to apply the texture to the part of the door handle that is still white) then the wall, then the floor, celling, the flooring of the kitchen (the one that is around the stove, or if you can't find it just apply the texture to the drain and the surrounding of drain,
then the microwave(btw don't forget to apply the texture to the surface around the buttons, if you hover where it usually on the buttons, move your cursor to the right, and when you see changing color, apply the texture on the surrounding of the microwave
the exhaust faucet texture is applied to the little white nob on the wastafel (or sink for americans)
kitchen stools are obviously for the seat close to the bed
and then the computer is obviously for the computer


and then do your magic, apply the HDRI_TEXT to the half ellipsoid.

don't forget to remove fog, and add some emission value to the HDRI so it appears bright for the vr player.
