Btw there is 

there is only 1 texture for the asphalt, so you can just apply the asphalt to all of the road shapes,

the grass is only for the pinpoint shaped (these textures usually start with "location shaped")
There are usually 2 components, sidewalk and asphalt, but the pinpoint shaped have 3 textures, asphalt, grass, and sidewalk, and the asphalt texture for the pinpoint shape is named Location shaped asphalt.

so basically the position is like this

			[T shape]

[pinpoint shaped]	[road1]	[road2]	[road3]

for tshape, road1, 2, and 3, just put the correct sidewalk, they are named the same as the location, if you are giving sidewalk for t shape, its sidewalk t shape, if its road 2, its sidewalk 2
